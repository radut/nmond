# Ncurses based System Performance Monitor for Darwin (Mac OS X)

This is a fork/port of [nmon](http://nmon.sourceforge.net/) (file lmon15g.c dated 2015-07-13); the original nmon would not run under OS X since Darwin (the version of BSD which underlies Mac OS X) does not provide a /proc directory, hence the fork. Since there is already a working version for Linux/Unix, this project does not seek to preserve compatibility with them. Most of the special code will be removed to make porting easier. We are primarily concerned with OS X at this time, but the code should compile on any other BSD variant as well.
